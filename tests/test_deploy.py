"""The systemd unit's restart limiter must fit the worker's own failure timescale.

`replicator.service` and `Settings` encode two halves of one decision: how long
the worker absorbs a broker outage before exiting, and how many such exits the
unit tolerates before staying `failed`. Documented in both places, enforced
here — raising the ceiling without widening the window silently restores the
failure mode the pairing exists to prevent (a permanently unreachable Redis that
reads as `active (running)` forever).
